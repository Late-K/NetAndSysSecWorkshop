    "Including a dictionary of breached passwords significantly improves real-world strength checking, along side this entropy score of ~100 means ~2^100 combinations, which is impractical for brute force attacks. Therfore the more unique and variety length a password has, the harder it is to crack\n",

    "#### Limitations\n",
    "This is however a very basic checker, limited only by length, variety, entropy and originality. This lack of checks for basic patterns means a password like \"aAaAaAaAaAaaaAaAaAa\" still scores increadibly high (Password strength score (1-10): 8) thanks so its length and case variety giving it a high entropy score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini reflection\n",
    "A lot more goes into creating a strong password than I have initially thought. Having made many passoword verifications in the past, sanitising inputs and creating regex patterns, not much thought was ever put into how these additions actually help to improve security from attackers. Cross checking with the common password list especially shows this, with passwords that would pass standard verification still scoring 0.\n"

    "The attack completes in miliseconds, with md5 being slightly slower than sha256 by a tiny amount. If the password isnt in the 100k world list, the program completes the entire search still in miliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Security analysis\n",
    "In a real life scenario, attackers would use common and leaked password lists which contain millions of previously breached passwords. Because algorithms like MD5 and SHA-256 are extremely fast, attackers can hash millions of guesses per second using GPU-powered cracking tools. Once a password hash database is stolen, a fast hash function effectively helps the attacker by allowing high-speed cracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why bcrypt is so good, by being intentially slow one hash takes much longer. This means multiple guesses become detrimental when cracking. When combined with per-user salts, bcrypt makes brute-forcing millions of accounts computationally impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini reflection\n",
    "The speed of how quickly attackers can crack passwords with the right tools is astonishing. Really puts into perspective what really happens when there is a major database breach, eg. linked in having their records leaked in 2024 must have had attackers on it like a fly to a flame. The code I produced also is increadibly simple, which can be concerning despite it being just an example. I have also tried to simulate a proper brute force attack with a friend by trying to crack a 2 byte salt, however the computational time was so high we had to give up. If i were to do this again, id try to optimise our brute force code, and try to crack a more secured hashed password using all of a hackers tools."

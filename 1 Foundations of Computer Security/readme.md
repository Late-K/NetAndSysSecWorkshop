Foundations of Computer Security

## Aims of the Seminar

Welcome to the Foundations of Computer Security. This workshop is designed for you
to learn about the fundamental concepts of computer security. The aim is to build on
the lecture material of giving you a practical understanding of security needs and
technologies.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Discuss computer security concepts in practical contexts
- Apply the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad to
  analyse security scenarios
- Differentiate between passive and active security attacks
- Identify fundamental security design principles and key terminology

## Workshop Outline:

1. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
2. Assessment First Step

## Final Conclusion and Reflection

This workshop had me explore the CIA triad within a group, applied to real world case studies, and my readiness for roles within the cyber security field.

In the first section with the CIA triad, we analysed major global cybersecurity incidents through confidentiality, integrity, and availability. My group focus was on the stuxnet worm, where I was in charge presenting our findings to our lecturer. As a group, the three of us did our own independant research, and then combined our findings into a single complete analysis. Studying Stuxnet in particular showed me how complex modern attacks can be, often affecting multiple areas of the CIA Triad at once. It also reinforced the importance of understanding security beyond theory, including physical consequences, zero-day vulnerabilities, and targeted malware.

For the second section, I looked for job application on indeed - matching the jobs mainly to this module, but included one full stack development job as someone mainly looking into software engineering. This task helped me recognise which skills I currently have and which areas I must develop. For example, I learned that hands-on experience with tools like SIEM platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and Microsoft Defender are increasingly demanded by employers.

Overall, this workshop helped me connect academic knowledge to real industry expectations. I now have a clearer understanding of what skills I need to work on next and how I can continue developing my cybersecurity career beyond university.

## Deadlines
Files must be submitted via learn.gold. Please check learn.gold deadline

## Important Information
All work is to be completed individually, except where explicitly
stated, and you will only be able to receive Marks for your own work.
You are responsible for the security and integrity of your own files, and
you must not permit others access to your assignment work.

Students are permitted to use AI tools used in an assistive role within
the assessment. However, the student must declare in the submission
the used tool(s) and how did you use it. Examples of where AI might
be used in an assistive category include:
- Drafting and structure content.
- Supporting the writing process in a limited manner.
- As a support tutor.
- Supporting a particular process such as translating
content.
- Giving feedback on content or proofreading content

However, students cannot use AI tools to do the assessment for
you as the work must be completely done by the students. All AI
generated content must be validated by the student.
You are expected to submit work in the file formats requested.
Submitting links to files saved elsewhere in the cloud will not be 
considered and will result in a zero mark. The actual files must be
loaded to learn.gold and readily available to the assessor. After
uploading and submitting your files, you must check that you can also
retrieve and open them. It is your responsibility to ensure files are not
corrupted at the time of submission and to report any issues
immediately to the help desk, copying in your lecturer and to seek
alternative arrangements when required.

## Tasks

accessible platform. It should be organised as a weekly log of your
work. You may include Jupyter Notebooks, python scripts, or PDF files

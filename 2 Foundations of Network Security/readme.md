# LAB 2

Networks and Systems Security
Week 02
Foundations of Network Security

## Aims of the Seminar

The aim is to build on the lecture
material of giving you a practical understanding of security needs and technologies.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Discuss computer security concepts in practical contexts
- Apply the RASA algorithm to analyse security scenarios

Workshop Outline:

1. RSA Algorithm / Socket library
2. Assesment work (Peer Discussion and Feedback)

## Final Conclusion and Reflection

Although I understood asymmetric cryptography in theory, building a working model gave me a much clearer sense of how real secure systems operate. Building and experimenting with these, trying to send other people private messeges, has further cemented this knowlage on cryptographic keys and networking protocols, giving me a valuable experience practically. If I were to do this again or take it further, i think itd be great to make a secure messenger app specifically for sharing large files among friends, most likely hosted a secure server.

The second part of the session, involving peer discussion, provided valuable insight into career readiness and how my existing strengths connect to industry expectations. Discussing job opertunities among myself and my peers really expanded my horisons on cyber security based jobs, seeing it not for just a defensive protocol based field, but also field in attack and vulnrability detection.

Overall, this workshop not only strengthened my technical understanding of cryptographic communication but also clarified my next steps for professional development.

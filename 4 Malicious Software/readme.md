# LAB 4

Networks and Systems Security
Week 04
Malicious Software

## Aims of the Seminar

This workshop begins with a conceptual overview of the main categories of malware,
their propagation mechanisms, and payload behaviours. Then we move into a
series of hands-on Python exercises designed to illustrate how malware can be
detected, analysed, and contained using simple yet powerful tools.

Rather than handling real malicious code, the activities simulate key behaviours—file
integrity checking, signature scanning, and worm propagation—so participants can
safely explore how malware interacts with systems.

By the end of the workshop, you
will have a clearer view of how malicious software functions, how it can be identified,
and how thoughtful countermeasures—both technical and human—can reduce its
impact.

Workshop Outline:

1. Explain the main categories of malware (virus, worm, trojan,
   spyware, rootkit, etc.).
2. Understand how malware propagates and hides itself.
3. Demonstrate basic malware detection and analysis principles
   using Python.
4. Apply file integrity checking and simple anomaly detection as
   defensive countermeasures.

## Final Conclusion and Reflection

This workshop tied together the core ideas behind how malware behaves and how it can be detected. Each task reinforced a different defensive concept, these include hashing catching subtle file changes, signature scanning demonstrating antivirus limits, and the worm simulation showing me just how quickly an infection can spread on a defenseless system. Bringing these elements together shows the value of layered security.

Reflecting on the exercises, I found these exercises to deepen my understanding far more than understanding concepts alone. Working through practical work helped clarify how detection systems think, why timing and baselines matter, and how easily attackers can exploit gaps in monitoring.

Overall, this lab gave me a clearer, more practical sense of how malware operates and how defenders can identify and contain threats. It showed that effective security depends on a mix of technical tools, careful observation, and an understanding of how systems behave under normal and abnormal conditions.

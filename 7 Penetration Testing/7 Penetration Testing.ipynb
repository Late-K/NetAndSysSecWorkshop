    "This workshop is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to some\n",
    "core concepts of Penetration Testing (Pen Testing). We will use Python\n",
    "to simulate and understand the initial stages of a penetration test,\n",

    "- Understand the purpose and basic principles of Penetration\n",

    "- Explore fundamental pen testing phases like reconnaissance and\n",
    "scanning using Python.\n",
    "- Gain familiarity with common tools and techniques used in ethical\n",

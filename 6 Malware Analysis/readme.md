# LAB 6

Networks and Systems Security
Week 06
Binary Analysis & Symbolic Execution

## Aims of the Seminar

This laboratory exercise introduces students to the core concepts and practices of
static malware analysis using Python. While traditional malware analysis often
involves virtualised environments and controlled execution of suspicious samples,
this lab focuses exclusively on safe, static techniques applied to benign Windows
executables from trusted sources. The objective is to develop the foundational skills
analysts rely on when triaging files, assessing potential risks, and extracting early
indicators of compromise.

Students will work directly with Windows Portable Executable (PE) files, including a
Sysinternals utility, which are safe to analyse. Through a series of structured tasks,
students will learn how to extract cryptographic hashes, identify meaningful strings,
read PE header information, evaluate imported functions, and apply basic YARA
rules. These steps collectively mirror the initial stages of a real-world malware
analysis workflow, allowing students to build confidence and familiarity before
advancing to more complex dynamic or reverse-engineering scenarios.
The lab operates entirely through Python-based tooling, enabling students to
understand not only how malware analysts interpret file structures, but also how
automated pipelines are developed within security operations environments. By the
end of the session, students will have a practical understanding of static triage
methods and an appreciation of how these techniques contribute to wider incident
response, threat intelligence, and detection engineering efforts.

Learning Outcomes:

1. Explain the role of static analysis in malware triage, including its purpose,
   strengths, and limitations within the broader malware analysis lifecycle.
2. Compute and interpret cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) as
   indicators of compromise, and explain how these identifiers are used in threat
   intelligence and incident response.
3. Extract and analyse human-readable strings from executable files, identifying
   potential artefacts such as file paths, registry references, and network
   indicators.
4. Inspect the structure of Windows PE files using Python, including reading
   header information, locating entry points, and examining imported libraries
   and API calls.
5. Detect simple behavioural characteristics using YARA rules, demonstrating
   how signature-based detection can be applied to classify files or identify
   suspicious patterns.
6. Conduct a complete static triage workflow, integrating hashing, string
   analysis, PE inspection, IOC extraction, and YARA matching into a coherent
   analytical process.
7. Interpret findings and articulate their significance, showing how extracted
   artefacts contribute to threat assessment, detection opportunities, and future
   investigation steps.

## Final Conclusion and Reflection

This lab gave me practical hands-on experience with the core steps of static malware analysis. This invloved hashing, string extraction, PE inspection, IOC discovery, and YARA matching, where i learned how each method contributes to the wider lense of security analysis.

What stood out to me the most is the speed at which you can perform such analysis, providing useful information on files quite quickly, with little and simple code. However, it is also very clear this has significant limits, with these techniques only analysing at surface level.

Overall, this lab helped me understand how static techniques fit into a broader investigation workflow and how they support threat intelligence and detection engineering. In future work, I’d like to explore how these same techniques are applied to more complex examples.

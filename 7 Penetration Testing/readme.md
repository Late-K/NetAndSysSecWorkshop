# LAB 7

Networks and Systems Security
Week 07
Penetration Testing

## Aims of the Seminar

This workshop is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to some
core concepts of Penetration Testing (Pen Testing). We will use Python
to simulate and understand the initial stages of a penetration test,
focusing on reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment. Pen testing is
not a "magic bullet" and should supplement a comprehensive security
strategy.

Learning Objectives:

- Understand the purpose and basic principles of Penetration
  Testing.
- Explore fundamental pen testing phases like reconnaissance and
  scanning using Python.
- Gain familiarity with common tools and techniques used in ethical
  hacking.

## Important Note (Ethics & Legality):

- ALWAYS obtain explicit, written permission before testing ANY
  system that you do not own.
- Conduct all activities within a designated, isolated test environment
  (e.g., a local VM, a dedicated test lab, or platforms like
  HackTheBox/OverTheWire).
- Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical. The scripts and tools
  here are for educational purposes only, within your own controlled
  environment.

## Final Conclusion and Reflection

This gave me a great understanding of finding infultration points through domain look up and port scanners, particularly using Nmap. Through simple scripts and reconnaissance you can gather basic information that is invaluable for mapping out potential weaknesess. This reinforced to me the vast amount of structure and methodical testing required for proper security or attack planning, but also highliting the limitations of surface level scanning, especially when systems use CDNs or intentionally hide information.

Overall, this exercise made me more aware of both the power and the responsibility that comes with these tools. It emphasised why ethical boundaries, permission, and controlled environments are essential.

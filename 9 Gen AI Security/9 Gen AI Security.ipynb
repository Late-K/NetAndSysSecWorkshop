Without consistency, systematic extraction would only capture noisy approximations of its behaviour.

It is however vulnerable to prompt injection, still attempting to reveal a fictional “system setup” when instructed to much like tinyllama. It doesnt adopt false claims in the poison test, continuing to give normal moon material answers, showing that it does not retain injected misinformation across requests. It also doesnt recall personal data in the inversion tests, instead again producing fictional identities, meaning there is minimal memorisation despite its stronger coherency.
